    I am a full-stack engineer with a foundation in <span style="color: rgb(251, 121, 22);">Java/Python</span>
    and <span style="color: rgb(251, 121, 22);">Javascript/React</span>.

    I enjoy working on challenging tasks that broaden my knowledge and develop my expertise. Software develoment to me is a skill that is aplicable to many different areas and allows one the freedom to pursue a career in the direction they desire, whether it be science, agriculture, finance, security, IOT, networking, automation, artificial intelligence, medicine, the list goes on.

    <br/><br/>

    As the world progresses, technology grows exponentially. So fast that technology already predominantely interweaves itself every asepct of our daily lives. People worry over the job security of software developers in the face of new AI advancements, but AI is meant to be a tool to advance the type of work that we do, not replace.

    I look forward to how technology progresses and how I can adapt to these changes.
